This project collects socio-economic data on towns and cities in France from the following website: https://www.linternaute.com/ville/c-villes-les-plus-pauvres. 

We then analyze the 20 cities with the highest average salaries, as well as examine salary levels in the 20 cities with the highest rates of RSA (Revenu de Solidarit√© Active), 
a basic income provided to individuals living below the poverty line.
